This Chrome extension will replace Jimmy Wales' face on the Wikipedia
fundraising banners with a #LOLCat from Flickr. It is customizable so
that you can use other Flickr tags for selecting the replacement photo.

The extension can be installed from this location:
https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ohahdlgbnlahpmnoiebchppfoiloccpk


Useful but missing features (wish list):
1. Prefetch the random image so that it displays quicker
2. Establish a listener for when the div/image that is injected by 
   Wikipedia's JS is there, so that the replacement will show quicker.
However, one could consider the delayed display of the replacement
image as a feature.
3. Pick a random image (instead of the first in that category) for
   preview on the options page.
